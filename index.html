      <p>I am not a chef. I enjoy cooking for the adventure of new flavors and for the stories that spring to life with each bite. In my marriage, my husband is the better cook. He is patient, reads the recipe multiple times to  ensure he is completing each correctly. I am the experimental chef. I will make a meal of wahtever is leftover in teh fridge and pantry. </p>
      <p> I grew up in a midwestern family that cooked what can be thought of as typical midwestern food, casseroles, meat and potato heavy meals. My mother's father was a beet farmer and she grew up growing all of her own food. 
        My father's father grew up in China but my grandmother did not know how to cook Chinese cuisine. </p>
      <p> I began cooking for myself my junior year of college. I bought a Home and Country Cooking magazine from Meijer. The focus of the magazine was 3 and 4 ingredient recipes. I would send the list of ingrediants to my brother during the week. He would purchase the necessary groceries. Then, on the weekend, I would go over and cook a meal for him and his wife. They were a patient audience who allowed me to experiment with flavor combinations. They offered suggestions and always ate what I cooked, no matter how inedible. It was throug this freedom that I learned to enjoy the fun of experimenting in the kitche. Now my inspirations come from a wide variety of cooking magazines, shows, and websites. </p>
